# CONTRIBUTING

This schema is developed by the [Cloud Work Stream](https://ga4gh.cloud) of the [Global Alliance for Genomics and Health](https://ga4gh.org).

## Semantic Versioning

We use [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) for TRS, this will determine if your proposed changes impact a major or minor release.

## Suggesting Changes

Suggested changes to this schema can be initiated as [**Issues**](https://github.com/ga4gh/tool-registry-service-schemas/issues) or [**Pull Requests**](https://github.com/ga4gh/workflow-execution-service-schemas/pulls) to allow for discussion and review. 

Even those with write access to the main repository should in general create pull request branches within their own forks. This way when the main repository is forked again, the new fork is created with a minimum of extraneous volatile branches.

<!-- activate after https://github.com/ga4gh/tool-registry-service-schemas/issues/60

> To facilitate review of external pull requests, users are encouraged to activate [**Travis CI**](https://travis-ci.org/) to monitor the build status (documentation, Swagger UI) of their fork. By following the documentation for [deployment to GitHub Pages](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/deployment/pages/) and adding a `$GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable to their repo configuration, pushes to the forked repo should be viewable relative to `https://[user-or-org].github.io/workflow-execution-service-schemas/preview/<branch>/`:
